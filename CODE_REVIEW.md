# Codebase Review: supabase-vector-search

## 1. Overall Code Quality

The codebase is well-structured and follows a clear set of conventions, as outlined in `AGENTS.md`. The use of TypeScript and the "database-first" approach provides a solid foundation. However, there are several areas where the code quality can be improved, particularly in terms of modularity, testing, and maintainability.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Monolithic Client:** The `VectorSearchClient` was a monolithic class responsible for too many concerns, including document management, search, and embedding generation.
*   **Lack of Testing:** The absence of a testing framework made it difficult to verify the correctness of the code and prevent regressions.
*   **Inflexible Multi-Vector Search:** The use of fixed columns for multi-vector search limited the flexibility of the library.
*   **Inconsistent Documentation:** The `AGENTS.md` file was out of sync with the actual project structure.

## 2. Architecture and Design

The overall architecture is sound, but the `VectorSearchClient` was a "god object" that violated the single-responsibility principle. The "database-first" approach is appropriate for this project, but the database schema could be improved to better support flexible multi-vector search.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Decompose `VectorSearchClient`:** The `VectorSearchClient` has been refactored to delegate responsibilities to a `DocumentManager` and a `SearchManager`. This improves modularity and makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
*   **Flexible Multi-Vector Search:** I recommend replacing the fixed `embedding_section_*` columns with a single `named_embeddings` JSONB column. This will allow for a dynamic number of named embeddings per document. A corresponding change to the `match_documents_weighted` function will be required.
*   **Embedding Provider Integration:** The `VectorSearchClient` has been updated to use the `embeddingProvider` to automatically generate embeddings during document insertion.

## 3. Maintainability and Technical Debt

The lack of tests and the monolithic `VectorSearchClient` were the two biggest sources of technical debt. The inconsistent documentation also made it difficult for new developers to understand the codebase.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Establish a Testing Framework:** A `vitest` testing framework has been established, and unit tests have been written for the `DocumentManager` and `SearchManager`. I recommend writing additional tests to cover more of the codebase, including integration tests for the database functions.
*   **Improve Documentation:** The `AGENTS.md` file has been updated to reflect the new project structure and the proposed multi-vector search implementation.
*   **Structured Logging:** A structured logging mechanism has been introduced to replace `console.warn` and provide better debugging information.

## 4. Actionable Refactors and Best Practices

The following refactors and best practices have been implemented or proposed:

*   **Refactored `VectorSearchClient`:** The `VectorSearchClient` has been refactored into smaller, more focused classes.
*   **Proposed Multi-Vector Search:** A more flexible multi-vector search implementation has been proposed.
*   **Established Testing Framework:** A `vitest` testing framework has been established.
*   **Updated Documentation:** The `AGENTS.md` file has been updated.
*   **Added Type Validation:** Embedding dimension validation has been added to the `SearchManager`.
*   **Implemented Structured Logging:** A structured logging mechanism has been implemented.

By addressing these issues, the `supabase-vector-search` library will be more robust, maintainable, and easier to use.
